<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>

<p>Said where are you goin'? Can I come too?</p>
<p>The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
<p>And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?</p>
<p>It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose</p>
<p>Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes</p>

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<p>I ain't comin' down, why would I need to?</p>
<p>So much of this world is above us, baby</p>
<p>They might tell you that I went crazy</p>
<p>I'm just tryna read you</p>
<p>Ooh, Ooh, ooh</p>

<h3> [Chorus]</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>I know we try</li>
    <li>And the days, they go by</li>
    <li>Until we get old</li>

    <li>People, they lie</li>
    <li>But hey, so do I</li>
    <li>Until it gets old</li>
    <li>There's water in the flowers, let's grow</li>
</ul>
